This PCB is a component of a breadboard power supply. It could be used to provide power to circuits implemented on a mini breadboard, which is a core part of electronics prototyping.
This breadboard power supply has following features:
  1. Plugs directly on the breadboard; therefore, there are no wires.
  2. Has an on/off switch.
  3. Can provide 5V and 3.3V power.
  4. Can draw power from a range of wall power supplies, from 6V to 12V.
The connection between the breadboard and the PCB is made via two sets of pin headers.
Also, I have added two double screw terminals to provide an additional way to output power via jumper wires instead of the pins.
